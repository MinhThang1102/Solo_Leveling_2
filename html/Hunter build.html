    <h2>Cha Hae-In</h2>
    <hp>
      The 9th S-Rank hunter discovered in South Korea and the vice guild master
      of the Hunters Guild. She was the strongest hunter in South Korea before
      Sung Jiwoo made his debut. Due to her special ability to smell mana, she
      goes about life with a handkerchief covering her nose. She is fascinated
      to discover that Sung Jiwoo is the only hunter she's ever encountered with
      a pleasant scent.

    <h2>Go Gunhee</h2>
    <p>
      The S-Rank chairman of the Korean Hunters Association, known as "The Sky
      Above the Skies." Despite his outstanding power and abilities, he rarely
      stands on the frontlines due to his age and medical conditions.

    <h2>Thomas Andre</h2>
    <hp>
      A National Level Hunter and the guild master of the Scavenger Guild. He
      has the power to inflict overwhelming violence. Perhaps the knowledge that
      few can touch him accounts for his carefree and eccentric nature. He likes
      things that make his pulse race, and takes interest in the power that Sung
      Jinwoo display

    <img src="/img/merei build.jpg" width="400" alt="Meirei" />
    <h2>Amamiya Mirei</h2>
    <p>
      A sword-wielding teen who engages in battle by borrowing the power of the
      warrior Oni Kuroha's soul. Since she's working as a hunter in secret, she
      always appears on the scene wearing an Oni mask. Because her personality
      is so different when she wears the mask and when she doesn't, it often
      feels like she's two different people.

    <img src="/img/se-mi build.jpg" width="400" alt="Han Se-Mi" />
    <h2>Han Se-Mi</h2>
    <p>
      An A-Rank healer who can save anyone's life as long as they're still
      breathing. She joined the Hunters Guild's B-Team to support her four
      younger siblings. Because she knows that she could die at any moment, she
      always carries a notebook with her will in her inner pocket
